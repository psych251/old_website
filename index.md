## Meeting Information

Monday, Wednesday, Friday (1:30PM - 2:50PM)\\
Room 420-050 (in the basement)

## Course Goals

Students completing Psych 251 will:

* Be able to perform a psychology experiment on the web,
* Be able to analyze a study in terms of reliability (e.g. power, statistical choices), and validity (e.g. design, sampling),
* Master best practices for experimental data management, storage, and analysis, and
* Have a reproducible workflow for experimental data analysis and visualization, including comfort with a variety of `R` tools, especially those in the `tidyverse`.

## Contact Information

We will be using Canvas for classroom communication. Please send messages to the entire course team (Mike, Andrew, Erin) at once to get the fastest turnaround.

## Pre-requisites

This course is a requirement for incoming graduate students in the Psychology department. It will be taught in the `R` statistical programming language and will be substantially easier if you have some prior experience with the language (even an online tutorial).

In addition, we will be relying heavily on version control using git and github. Please take a moment to set up a git account at https://github.com/, and to get it working on your computer before class starts.

This is not a statistics course. We will talk a bit about the philosophy of statistical inference, but we won't teach you how to do particular tests or do regression modeling. For those topics, we recommend Psych 252 (Winter). If you have taken an undergraduate statistics course, you should be fine, but if you have never taken *any* statistics, please consult with Mike to find out if Psych 251 is right for you.  

## Readings

Please complete all readings before the class for which they are assigned. We will be using many of the techniques and workflows described in Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's book, [R for Data Scientists](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is available free online. I highly recommend using it as a reference book.

## Grading

* 40%: Problem sets (four, at 10% each);
* 50%: Final project components, including presentations, data collection, analysis, and writeup;
* 10%: Attendance and participation in class. I expect students to show up on time and to be engaged with the discussion.

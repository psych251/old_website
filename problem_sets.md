title: Problem Sets
---

All problem sets will be due Sunday night by midnight.

Problem sets will be graded on a 1 - 5 rubric, with 5 being thorough and complete, 4 including one or two minor errors, 3 being incomplete or including at least one major error or quite a number of minor ones, 2 being seriously incomplete/incorrect, and 1 being barely attempted.

## Submitting Problem Sets

Please submit problem sets via sending an email to the [course instructors list](mailto://psych251-aut1718-staff@lists.stanford.edu). Aside from Problem Set 1, all submissions should include an HTML link to your rendered problem set. You can generate this sort of link using [RPubs](http://rpubs.com) by hitting "publish" in RStudio and following the directions. Or you can push your problem set to a github repository and use [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/) html preview to generate a link.

## Problem Set 1 - Git (due 10/1)

Follow the steps in the [git tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HSXY9LVoorPweLPBn5LkDUDSwA1ST_pGCkWxc47b_rw/edit#heading=h.y4i1ok9i1v35) and submit the final product.

## Problem Set 2 - Data wrangling (due 10/15)

This problem set will build `tidyverse` data-wrangling skills. The problem set is available in the [problem sets repository](https://github.com/psych251/problem_sets). Download it, fill in all the missing code (and narrative answers, where relevant). Then knit it and submit following the instructions above.

## Problem Set 3 - Analytic Reproducibility (due 11/5)

This problem set will be a contribution to a meta-science project led by Tom Hardwicke, investigating analytic reproducibility in the journal Psychological Science.

Analytic reproducibility refers to the ability to obtain a published article's reported outcomes by re-running the reported analyses. This type of reproducibility is a minimum level of quality we would expect for any scientific finding to be trustworthy and informative. How often are published psychology articles reproducible?

In practice it is often difficult to evaluate an article's analytic reproducibility because the raw data is not readily available. However, many journals have started to introduce 'open data' policies that encourage or mandate that raw data is made available in an online repository (like the OSF). In this Problem Set, we will capitalise on the availability of a corpus of raw datasets released with articles published in the journal Psychological Science as part of the 'Open Badges' scheme. In a previous project (Kidwell et al., 2016), we identified a number of datasets that are reusable in principle - now let's see if they are reusable in practice!

### Step 1 Background reading
Read the [pre-registered protocol](https://osf.io/t5x7f/) for background on the project

### Step 2 Identify your assigned articles and CARPS co-pilot

Identify your [CARPS copilots and assigned articles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10cCnqzI7g7URJy3fErgUAK3orzaV1llHn_U507gr-B0/edit?usp=sharing). Then contact your co-pilot and arrange to meet up and work on your reports together.

### Step 3 Conduct your reproducibility check
Please follow the ["Reproducibility Checks Step By Step" guide](http://rpubs.com/tommetascience/CARPS) for detailed instructions.

### Step 4 Submit your CARPS reports via a Github pull request

If you have any questions or encounter any issues please feel free to e-mail Tom (tom.hardwicke[@]stanford.edu).

## Problem Set 4 - Visualization (due 12/3)

This problem set will aim to build visualization skills using `ggplot`.
